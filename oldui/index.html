                                        <p class="page-header-text">Ever wonder about how to store your message, information, file permanently? Something that is very important to you, some precious memory, picture, sound, video, even just plain messages. You want to store it forever, 10 years, 20 years, 100 years, even after you died, to pass it down to your children and grand grand grand children. How can you store something permanently? Have you thought about it?

The  most popular methods many people use are pendrive, SSD Hard Disk, cloud storage, multiple PCs. Some also use paper or hardcopy storage.  CD, DVD, ec tera.

“The optimum solution is when one stores copies in a distant location from originals, so that if a certain threat (such as theft, fire or earthquake) occurs at one location, the other will not be subject to it. Some feel the most secure practice is to store data in three distant places” [1]



Yes, storing the information using the above method may last very long. But the problem is what if you lost it? A pendrive, SSD harddisk, physical storage, dvd can be lost, misplaced, stolen, after a long period of time. It can be lost during transit, damaged, stolen, move house etc. Pendrive can be faulty after sometime. “Condensation from high temperatures or high humidity can also cause the shorting of circuit board or corrosion of contacts.” [2]

“recordable CD-RWs seemed to be a particularly durable and secure carrier. Optimists estimated that they would last for 20 to 30 years. However, real life has proven otherwise. Manufacturers introduced discs of variable quality on the market, some of those would not endure even one year.” [1]

What about cloud storage? Drop box, Google cloud, Microsoft Cloud, they are very reliable right? Yes, but hacking always happens, it happened in the past, and it will happen in the future again. Your information stored in the cloud storage can be lost, modified, hacked, or deleted due to being inactive for many years. So it is not permanent storage. Even Apple iCloud can be hacked [3].

“However, the biggest cause of concern for Cloud storage isn’t hacked data, it’s lost data. Dropbox recently had a glitch in their sync system that left many subscribers with lost files. For those who only had their files hosted on Dropbox, there was no possible way to retrieve them.” [4]

Thus this is what this project is trying to solve. A very easy method to store your message/file/information permanently and very low cost. Just store and forget. Come back 1 year, 5 years,1 decade, 10 decades or longer later to retrieve your information. We store your messages on the blockchain. No one can delete, modify, and steal your information. If you don't want your information to be known public, you can encrypt it. No one can see your information without knowing the secret key.

Cost, how much? It is very cheap, about  $0.1 per message! Just pay once only! No need to pay yearly like cloud storage. If you store files, the cost depends on your file size. And you can view or retrieve your information anytime free of charge.

Once your message is stored in the blockchain, it will remain in the blockchain forever. Blockchain is immutable, undeletable, secure and time stamped. The message once stored will remain there forever, no one can delete it or  modify it.
